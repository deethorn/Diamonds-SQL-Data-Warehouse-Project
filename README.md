#🏗️ Data Architecture
This project adopts the Medallion Architecture, structured into Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers to ensure scalable and organized data flow:

Bronze Layer: Captures raw data as received from source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into the SQL Server database without transformation.

Silver Layer: Applies data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to prepare the dataset for reliable analysis.

Gold Layer: Delivers business-ready data modeled in a star schema, optimized for reporting and analytical tasks.
